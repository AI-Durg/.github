# TFUG Durg Code of Conduct

TFUG Durg is dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all members, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion, or experience level. We expect all members to adhere to the following code of conduct when participating in any TFUG Durg activities, both online and offline.

## Be Respectful

Treat everyone with respect and kindness. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or disrespect. Remember that everyone has different experiences and perspectives. Please be considerate and thoughtful in your interactions with others.

## Be Inclusive

We welcome people of all backgrounds, identities, and perspectives to join TFUG Durg. We strive to create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard. Discrimination, harassment, and exclusionary behavior are not tolerated.

## Be Collaborative

We encourage collaboration and teamwork within our community. Help and support your fellow members whenever possible. Be open to learning from others and sharing your knowledge and experiences.

## Be Mindful

Be mindful of your language and behavior, both online and offline. Harassment, trolling, derogatory comments, personal attacks, and offensive language are not acceptable. Remember that what may be acceptable or humorous to you may be offensive to others.

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please report it to the community organizers immediately. All reports will be handled with confidentiality and will be taken seriously. We are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful community for all members.

## Consequences of Violations
